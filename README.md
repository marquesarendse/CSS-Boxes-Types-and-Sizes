Understanding Type in CSS
The majority of people find ugly and badly designed websites to be bothersome, and they all concur that there is something clearly wrong with the way these pages appear. The fonts and the spacing are the two primary problems.

Generally speaking, non-designers divide typefaces into two categories: 
1.Serif.
2.Sans serif.

Small lines known as serifs are found at the ends of the letters in serif fonts.The text was easier to read because of the serifs that connected the letters. 
Sans serif fonts are more contemporary in style and lack serifs. Sans serif fonts are primarily used on the web for longer text when computer typesetting because they have a clean, readable appearance.

Your web page will request a font from the user's device if one is not specifically listed. This restricts the font selection you can make when using CSS. A font stack is the practice of specifying multiple fonts at once in order to ensure compatibility.

People use a variety of gadgets, including desktop computers, tablets, and phones, to access websites. While some people only have the default fonts installed on their devices, others have many fonts installed. If a font isn't mentioned explicitly, your website will request it from the user's device. This restricts the font options available to you when using CSS. It's common practice to specify multiple fonts at once (referred to as a font stack) to ensure compatibility.
